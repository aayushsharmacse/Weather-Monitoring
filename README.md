# Weather-Monitoring
## Objective:
Develop a real-time data processing system to monitor weather conditions and provide
summarized insights using rollups and aggregates. The system will utilize data from the
OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/).

The system should continuously call the OpenWeatherMap API at a configurable interval
(e.g., every 5 minutes) to retrieve real-time weather data for the metros in India. (Delhi,
Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Hyderabad)

## [ Please continuously monitor console for progress and the final result will also be declared by alert wait for it]
